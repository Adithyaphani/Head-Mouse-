HEAD MOVEMENT BASED CURSOR CONTROL 
WITH HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION
It focuses on the design and implementation of a 
head mouse, an innovative assistive technology aimed at enhancing accessibility and 
independence for such individuals. The system utilizes a microcontroller combined with a 
gyroscope to create a cost-effective solution. Its core functionality involves translating head 
movements into cursor movements, enabling users to control devices without conventional 
input methods. The system also integrates connectivity features, providing flexibility for use 
in various environments. Furthermore, it incorporates a lithium battery charging mechanism 
(03962A) to ensure sustained and reliable power, enhancing its portability
